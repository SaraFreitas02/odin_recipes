<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
  <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
  <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
  <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
  <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
  <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until browned.
      Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
      seasoning, 1 tablespoon of salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Cover and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours,
      stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in the boiling water
      for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
      egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
      lengthwise over the meat sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with one-third of
      the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
      Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers, and top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to
      prevent sticking, either spray the foil with cooking spray or ensure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
      before
      serving.</li>
  </ol>
