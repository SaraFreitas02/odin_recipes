## Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment was to **create a simple recipe website using HTML**. This project helped practice the `basics of HTML`, including creating lists, linking pages, and embedding images.

<br>

## Assignment Requirements

This project involves creating a recipe website that adheres to the following requirements:

### Recipe Page Requirements:

Each recipe page should include:

- A visually appealing `image` showcasing the finished dish.
- A brief and engaging `description` of the dish beneath the image.
- An `unordered list`of all necessary ingredients.
- An `ordered list` providing clear, step-by-step preparation instructions.

### Website Requirements:

The website must:

- Feature at least `three` unique and distinct `recipes`.
- Include a homepage with intuitive `navigation links` to each recipe page.

<br>

## Note for Beginners

This project includes `extra features` beyond the basic assignment requirements.
If your project looks different, **don't worry or feel discouraged**. Each project is unique and reflects the developer's individual learning journey.

Focus on understanding the core concepts and completing the assignment to the best of your ability.

The goal is to learn and improve your skills, not to create an identical copy.
Keep experimenting, practicing, and don't hesitate to seek help if needed.

Happy coding!
