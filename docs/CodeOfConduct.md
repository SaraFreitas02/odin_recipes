## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and respectful environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a `harassment-free` experience for everyone.

Our goal is to create a healthy space for learning and collaboration, where `no one feels judged, inferior, excluded, or inadequate`. To achieve this, we commit to approaching all interactions with `respect and empathy` and to avoid taking or making comments personally.

Regardless of who you are or your background, we are all here with a shared goal: to improve this project and expand our collective knowledge. This mission should remain our primary focus at all times.

---

## Our Standards

To maintain a welcoming and respectful environment, all participants in our community are expected to uphold the following standards:

**1. Respectful Communication**
Use kind and inclusive language when engaging with others. `Critique ideas constructively` and avoid personal attacks or derogatory comments.

**2. Collaboration and Support**
Foster an environment where everyone feels encouraged to contribute. Offer `help and guidance` whenever possible, and `celebrate the achievements` of others.

**3. Inclusivity**
Value and `respect different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds`. Ensure that everyone feels included and recognized for their contributions.

**4. Professional Conduct**
Behave in a manner that reflects `positively on the community and project`. Refrain from inappropriate, disrespectful, or discriminatory behavior.

**5. Focus on Growth**
Remember that our shared goal is to improve this project and expand our collective knowledge. `Stay open to feedback, and approach learning as a collaborative effort`.

**6. Accountability**
Take `responsibility for your actions and words`. If mistakes are made, acknowledge them, and work to make amends where necessary.

<br>

### Unacceptable Behaviors:
To ensure a safe and harassment-free environment, the following behaviors will not be tolerated under any circumstances:

**1. Harassment or Discrimination:**
Making `offensive, hurtful, or disrespectful comments`.

**2. Personal Attacks or Threats:**
Directing `hostility, insults, or intimidation` toward any individual or group.

**3. Hateful or Exclusionary Language:**
Using language or imagery that is `intentionally harmful, derogatory, or designed to exclude others`.

**4. Disruptive Behavior:**
Any conduct that undermines the collaborative environment, including `trolling, spamming, or repeatedly interrupting discussions`.

**5. Sharing Inappropriate Content:**
Posting or sharing content that is `offensive, explicit, or otherwise unrelated to the project`.

**6. Dishonesty or Misrepresentation:**
`Misleading others` about your contributions, qualifications, or intentions within the project.

**7. Retaliation:**

<br>

#### Disclaimer: 
The behaviors listed here are not exhaustive. `Any actions or comments that create a hostile, disrespectful, or harmful environment may also be deemed unacceptable`, even if not explicitly mentioned.

If your behavior is questioned, `you are encouraged to explain your intentions`. Open communication is valued, but this does not guarantee that certain actions will be considered acceptable. The primary goal is to `maintain a respectful and collaborative environment` for everyone.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for `clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior` and are expected to `take appropriate and fair corrective action` in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to `remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions` that are not aligned with this _Code of Conduct_, or to `ban temporarily or permanently any contributor` for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This _Code of Conduct_ applies to `all contributions and interactions within the projectâ€™s spaces, as well as in public spaces` when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Examples of `project spaces` include, but are _not limited to_:

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through [email](mailto:sarafreitasemail@gmail.com).
